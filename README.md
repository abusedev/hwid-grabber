## Installation
Download [here](https://github.com/abusedev/hwid-grabber/releases)

## Where do I put my HWID?
Head [here](https://@buse/forums/whitelist.16/) on the forum. You can create a new Thread and post your HWID. Please post your HWID there, not in Discord.

## How long until I gain access?
This can vary. But typically our team checks the forums multiple times per day. If you do not gain access within half a day there is an issue.

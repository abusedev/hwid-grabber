## Installation
Download [here](https://github.com/kamishirodev/hwid-grabber/releases)

## Where do I put my HWID?
Head to the [forum](https://kamishiro.dev/forums), there will be a Minecraft category and there will be a HWID sub category. Please post your HWID there, not in Discord.

## How long until I gain access?
This can vary. But typically our team checks the forums multiple times per day. If you do not gain access within half a day there is an issue.
